# Randomtrialpicker
The PubMed database contains millions of citations of biomedical literature. Apart from clinical trials, 
the database also contains many books, review articles, and biostatistical articles. In this project,
I filtered the clinical trial reports out of the PubMed database and wrote a small website which
displays a random entry of this dataset.

This website is useful if you want to gather inspiration on how other people report their clinical trial data. Looking at random trials
gives an unbiased view into reporting techniques used in the clinical literature.
